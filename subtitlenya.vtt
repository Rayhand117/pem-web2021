00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:09.381
ODOSSI

00:00:09.381 --> 00:00:10.709
Did you have a good time at home during Chuseok? (Korean holiday)

00:00:11.331 --> 00:00:14.545
I hope there is no holiday.

00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:16.742
-I'm so stressed out on holidays.
-Why?

00:00:16.742 --> 00:00:20.483
My parents nag me too much.

00:00:20.483 --> 00:00:21.593
What? They want you to die?

00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:24.330
Or why did you come home?

00:00:24.668 --> 00:00:27.359
t's not that. Marry her.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.348
You're nagging me to marry anyone.

00:00:30.348 --> 00:00:34.033
You don't even have a girlfriend because your parents nag you.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.449
That's right. I was born with this face.

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:37.864
It's my parents' fault that I was born like this.

00:00:37.864 --> 00:00:40.320
Your parents are still married, aren't they?

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.662
So it's my parents' fault that they made me look like this.

00:00:42.662 --> 00:00:46.473
-You can live, too.
-That's not the problem. Did anything happen to you?

00:00:46.473 --> 00:00:49.009
I'm not going home for the holidays anymore.

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:51.269
Did your parents nag you, too?

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.415
-It's not that, it's so sad for my father.
-What happened?

00:00:54.415 --> 00:01:00.073
My nephew came home and my dad gave me pocket money, but I didn't give him any.

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:05.000
-How old is your nephew?
-4 years old. 6 years old.

00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:08.171
What are you sad about?

00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:11.778
You shouldn't get allowance from your parents, you should give it to them.

00:01:11.778 --> 00:01:13.994
-I gave my parents my allowance, too.
-Where's your money?

00:01:13.994 --> 00:01:16.241
I took out the allowance Dad gave me for my nephew.

00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:19.498
"Don't tell your mom!" I took it out.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:28.701
Your parents must be worried about you. You have no job, no money, no women, no future.

00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:30.726
-I don't have a woman?
-You don't have a girl.

00:01:30.726 --> 00:01:33.266
I went home and dated a girl this time.

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:37.155
-You with a girl?
-I had a really pretty friend when I was in elementary school.

00:01:37.155 --> 00:01:40.546
-I had a date with her.
-How close are you?

00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:42.358
It's a girl, but it's a old friend.

00:01:42.358 --> 00:01:45.495
She's a girl. She's very close to you.

00:01:45.495 --> 00:01:48.664
-She and I almost dated a little.
-You're dating her.

00:01:48.664 --> 00:01:53.403
I met her with the intention of dating her anyway. She was walking over there, and I was so reminded of the old days.

00:01:53.403 --> 00:01:54.336
So what did you do?

00:01:54.336 --> 00:01:58.959
-I said hello to her like old times.
-You hugged her?

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.133
No. Ass poking!!

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:02.794
I attacked her right behind her.

00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:05.786
She was looking somewhere else, so I was  ass poking right away.

00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:09.317
I haven't seen her for a long time and I can't go empty-handed.

00:02:09.317 --> 00:02:11.210
I took a little gift.

00:02:11.868 --> 00:02:13.939
I gave her a present while I was talking.

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.711
Gift? What gift?

00:02:15.907 --> 00:02:21.485
I told her.
"I liked you when you were a kid. That's why I collected a little when I thought of you."

00:02:21.485 --> 00:02:23.907
-Can you take my gift?
-What's that?

00:02:24.387 --> 00:02:25.666
Fart

00:02:27.263 --> 00:02:28.481
crazy guy

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:29.091
Fart

00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:30.873
Get your hands off me!

00:02:30.873 --> 00:02:32.769
She must have hated it.

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.026
-No, she doesn't hate it. Do you know what she did when I farted?
-How?

00:02:36.026 --> 00:02:37.426
She said, "I have something for you, too."

00:02:38.297 --> 00:02:39.879
She said, "Fart!!!"

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.208
A woman farted with her legs up like this?

00:02:47.328 --> 00:02:49.020
But she's gonna feel pretty bad.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.765
I said something to make you feel better.

00:02:51.765 --> 00:02:53.544
Did you tell her things that made her feel good?

00:02:53.544 --> 00:02:56.192
-I'll tell her I'll...
"Are you on YouTube?"
-"No, I don't."

00:02:56.192 --> 00:02:59.689
"You don't do YouTube? But my heart subscribed to you."

00:03:00.507 --> 00:03:02.568
"I like you!"

00:03:04.275 --> 00:03:06.820
It's so cheesy. It's trash.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.201
I said to her, "I like you," and she said, "I block you" and went home.

00:03:14.598 --> 00:03:17.227
I think you can't meet a girl.

00:03:17.227 --> 00:03:19.872
But she was my ideal type.

00:03:19.872 --> 00:03:23.025
If I meet a girl like that again, I will definitely get married.

00:03:23.025 --> 00:03:31.126
Then tell me your ideal type. Then I'll find her and introduce you to her.

00:03:31.126 --> 00:03:32.904
-My ideal type?
-Tell me your ideal type.

00:03:32.904 --> 00:03:34.048
My ideal type is...

00:03:34.048 --> 00:03:37.888
A woman who knows how to decorate herself.

00:03:37.888 --> 00:03:40.480
For example... (scanning a woman)

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.674
A pretty woman with good makeup.

00:03:43.674 --> 00:03:46.859
Every time they put on makeup, they have different charms.

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.686
Those women put cosmetics on the table.
(Woman: That's right. )

00:03:50.686 --> 00:03:51.933
(Woman: Huh?)

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:54.513
(Woman: Let's clean up the cosmetics first.)
Yes, they fix their makeup from time to time.

00:03:54.513 --> 00:03:59.046
My ideal type is someone who makes himself look good.
(Woman: Let's hide this, too.)

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.750
Do you think women like that fix makeup often?

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.993
-I'm in big trouble if her make-up gets erased.
-Why?

00:04:05.993 --> 00:04:07.165
Her pores are this big.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.353
-There are so many sweat pores on my face.
-She's filling it with makeup?

00:04:11.353 --> 00:04:13.095
That's right. Make it up with cosmetics.

00:04:13.095 --> 00:04:15.273
-You don't care if she's that kind of woman?
-I don't care.

00:04:15.273 --> 00:04:18.969
If I'm dating her.

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:22.179
I'll take you to the construction site right away on the day we date.

00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:24.400
Why take her to the construction site?

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.732
Her sweat pores are big, so we should fill her up with cement at the construction site.

00:04:28.732 --> 00:04:32.841
Concrete on her face?

00:04:32.841 --> 00:04:37.114
Then her face will be clogged.

00:04:37.114 --> 00:04:44.899
If you fill her pores with cement, the cement might crack over time, so what do you do?

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:49.310
Then I'll shoot silicon in her cracked face.

00:04:54.343 --> 00:04:56.328
What else is your ideal type?

00:04:56.328 --> 00:04:58.825
(Woman: What else do you ask?)
I'm also... (Scanning her again)

00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:05.202
-Usually men like sexy women.
-That's right. Sexy girl.

00:05:05.913 --> 00:05:09.510
I don't like women who dress sensibly.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:15.920
So my ideal type is a woman who always takes her jacket with her. Not sexy clothes.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.523
(Woman: Huh? No...)

00:05:18.003 --> 00:05:21.482
The color of the jacket is black.
(Woman: Me??)

00:05:21.482 --> 00:05:23.304
(Woman: What is it?) (Suspicious)

00:05:23.304 --> 00:05:26.085
Her clothes feel like a dress.

00:05:27.134 --> 00:05:31.840
a bright dress with a jacket
(Woman: No way. I don't think so.)

00:05:33.743 --> 00:05:36.534
a woman with her hair tied to her hair

00:05:36.534 --> 00:05:38.534
(Woman: Definitely me!!))LOLLL

00:05:38.534 --> 00:05:42.704
-You look like a girl in a fairy tale.
-It's like Rapunzel.
(Woman: What's wrong with you guys?LOLLLL)

00:05:42.704 --> 00:05:50.316
Do you know why women like that don't wear clothes that show their backs because it's hot these days?

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:52.495
She has a lot of hair on her back.

00:05:54.202 --> 00:05:56.506
(Women: Audience Mode ON)

00:05:56.506 --> 00:06:00.344
If you look at her from afar, you'll think her skin is originally black.

00:06:00.344 --> 00:06:04.039
-A black pig?
-That's the black pig feeling.

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:08.529
-You don't care about a woman like that?
-Oh, I don't care.

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:12.513
I'm going to pull out her back with a tweezers.

00:06:12.513 --> 00:06:15.479
You're going to pick all of them?

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.376
I'll pull it out every time she has hair on her back and I'll collect it all.

00:06:19.376 --> 00:06:21.736
What's the use of collecting those hairs?
(Woman: Why??) (Suddenly speaking LOLLLL)

00:06:21.736 --> 00:06:24.487
I'll collect her fur and make her clothes.

00:06:24.487 --> 00:06:27.145
-What clothes?
-Paca. A parka made of back hair.

00:06:27.145 --> 00:06:31.859
A backshair parka you couldn't even build on North Face?

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.993
It's a meaningful clothing.

00:06:37.993 --> 00:06:41.887
She has more hair on her back than a Wolverine beard.

00:06:42.883 --> 00:06:45.104
What about another ideal type?

00:06:46.207 --> 00:06:48.080
(Woman: What else?)
I have...

00:06:48.685 --> 00:06:51.403
I like it when women cross their legs.

00:06:51.403 --> 00:06:56.465
-Women sitting cross-legged?
-Uh. Crossing his legs and then loosening them.
(Woman: Correcting her posture quickly.)

00:06:56.465 --> 00:07:00.309
(Woman: Loosen it? Let's twist it again.)

00:07:01.501 --> 00:07:03.003
You like her, don't you?

00:07:03.003 --> 00:07:08.781
Shoes are a bit of a booty.
(Woman: Is it me again?)

00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:09.954
It's so nice when a woman with crossed legs wears boots.

00:07:09.954 --> 00:07:12.573
I told you I liked a girl who wasn't sexy.

00:07:12.573 --> 00:07:13.933
(Woman: Enjoying LOLLLLL)

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:16.471
She dresses so that no one can see her toes.

00:07:16.471 --> 00:07:18.904
I'm afraid you've only seen her there. You didn't see the essence.

00:07:18.904 --> 00:07:22.164
You didn't see her alone. If there's no one around and she's alone, right?

00:07:22.164 --> 00:07:26.139
Take off your boots and just scratch between your toes with your fingers.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.320
I'm scratching my finger, and when another guest comes in, I secretly smell...

00:07:34.774 --> 00:07:35.880
She's that kind of course.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.884
You don't care if she's that kind of girl?

00:07:38.884 --> 00:07:42.225
I don't care.
(Woman: Laughing and Cold LOLLL)

00:07:42.225 --> 00:07:46.851
How stressful would she be because of the smell of her feet? She can't even drive with anyone else.

00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:49.157
When other people get in the car with her, they're like...
"What's this smell?" .

00:07:49.157 --> 00:07:54.569
So I'm going to give the car an air freshener for her. (Korean traditional bean dishes. It smells bad)

00:07:57.183 --> 00:08:02.433
You don't know where this smells when people get in the car.

00:08:02.433 --> 00:08:06.976
A woman can be confident.

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:11.255
There's no woman like that around me.

00:08:11.255 --> 00:08:14.784
But my ideal type came here.

00:08:14.784 --> 00:08:18.244
She said she'd block me, but I think she unblocked me.

00:08:18.244 --> 00:08:20.805
I didn't know she was coming here.

00:08:21.196 --> 00:08:23.881
Don't move. Ice!!

00:08:23.881 --> 00:08:24.828
Don't move!!!

00:08:24.828 --> 00:08:27.068
(Woman: Don't tell me...) It's not what I think it is it? Come quickly, my friend.)

00:08:27.068 --> 00:08:27.960
Don't say anything and stay here.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.751
Do you have meju in your bag?

00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:33.696
I can't go to her empty-handed, so take meju or something.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.292
-Hello.
- (Women: Ice!! LOLLL)

00:08:38.292 --> 00:08:39.698
(Woman: I can't stand it. LOLLL)

00:08:39.698 --> 00:08:41.028
You like me.

00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:44.932
Hi. I'm not a weirdo.

00:08:44.932 --> 00:08:46.911
Woman: I think you're a weirdo. LOLLL

00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:51.114
-Oh really? You have a very bright personality.
-She noticed. You're a weirdo.

00:08:53.906 --> 00:08:56.364
I saw you from the side and you look like a girl who lives in the Alps.

00:08:56.364 --> 00:09:02.490
Tie your hair in pigtails, wear a black jacket and boots.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:07.186
I like blocked boots.

00:09:07.737 --> 00:09:11.115
I love how you keep fixing your makeup.

00:09:11.115 --> 00:09:13.929
Don't just put it in like that.

00:09:13.929 --> 00:09:17.337
She likes it too much. She's open-minded.

00:09:17.337 --> 00:09:18.839
(Woman: Honestly, I'm having fun now.LOLLLL)

00:09:18.839 --> 00:09:20.281
Why are you suddenly closing your heart?

00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:24.197
I'll give you a present to reopen your mind.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:30.529
-It's hard to fix your makeup every day, isn't it?
-Woman: Yes.

00:09:30.529 --> 00:09:32.252
As a gift...

00:09:34.671 --> 00:09:38.557
I'll fill your pores with silicone.

00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:42.011
Do you want me to shoot you?

00:09:43.754 --> 00:09:45.249
Why did you bring this?

00:09:45.249 --> 00:09:46.173
Woman: Give it to me. LOLLL

00:09:46.173 --> 00:09:47.735
Are you accepting my heart?

00:09:47.735 --> 00:09:52.314
Woman: I'll shoot you.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-She's so bright.
